# WAP Parser

## README.md

This script opens a downloaded json file from the WiFi Pineapple. The file contains information from a recon scan. The script parses the json file, removes duplicate SSIDs, and outputs the number of APs, Associated Clients, the channel numbers used, the AP security encryption used, and the number of unassociated clients used.
